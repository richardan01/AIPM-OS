| 95% CI on θ̂ | [<lo>, <hi>] via bootstrap (B=20000) — judge-graded evals only |
| Status      | ✅ pass / ❌ regression |

**Per-eval grading method** (so reviewers can see at a glance which judges were involved):
| Eval | Method | Judge TPR_test | Judge TNR_test |
|---|---|---|---|
| 04 | programmatic (`grade.sh`) | — | — |

**Failures:**
- <criterion-id> ❌ — <one-line description of what failed>

**Introspection:**
> Why did the runner produce this output? What in the workflow or context led to this?

**Remediation:**

**Result file:** `<suite>/results/YYYY-MM-DD_<model>.md`
```

### Bias-corrected success rate (Hamel §5.6)

For judge-graded evals only. With raw observed pass rate `p_obs = k/N` and judge calibration `TPR_test`, `TNR_test`:

```
θ̂ = (p_obs + TNR_test - 1) / (TPR_test + TNR_test - 1)
```

The corrected θ̂ is the citable number. Leave blank for programmatic and manually-graded evals (raw rate is already unbiased there).

Confidence interval: bootstrap with B = 20000 resamples over the labeled examples used to compute TPR/TNR.

## Run history

### 2025-01-15 — onboarding — claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2025-01-15 |
| Suite | onboarding |
| Model | `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` |
| Commit SHA | `b94a501` |
| Runner | Session A (fresh clone, no prior context) |
| Grader | Session B (separate invocation, transcript-only) |
| Fixture(s) | `jordan-lee-profile.md` (Executive operator) |
| Score | 11 / 12 |
| Status | ✅ pass |

**Failures:**

- `07-per-step-interactivity` ❌ — At Phase 9, the runner presented all three proposed file writes (`CLAUDE.md`, `GOALS.md`, `Tasks/active.md`) in a single message and accepted a single "yes, go ahead" reply as authorization to write all three. Criteria requires individual per-file confirmation.

**Introspection:**

> The Phase 9 prompt in `Workflows/interactive-onboarding.md` read: "Shall I write all proposed files?" — this phrasing invited a batch approval. The runner correctly asked before writing (eval 02 passed), but the granularity of confirmation was insufficient. The model followed the prompt faithfully; the bug was in the prompt wording, not model behavior.

**Remediation:**

- Phase 9 prompt tightened to enumerate each file by name and require a per-file confirmation before writing. Phrasing changed from "Shall I write all proposed files?" to "I'll confirm each file individually. First: `CLAUDE.md` — does this look right to write?" with subsequent turns for each remaining file.
- Added `taylor-polite-acks.md` fixture to the fixture set to stress this failure mode explicitly in future runs.

### 2026-06-10 — onboarding — claude-fable-5

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-06-10 |
| Suite | onboarding |
| Model | `claude-fable-5` |
| Commit SHA | `8f1e329d88f3d536116fc7bacee7ad80e18e0774` |
| Runner | eval-runner sub-agent (isolated context) |
| Grader | eval-grader sub-agent (isolated context) |
| Fixture(s) | `jordan-lee-profile.md`, `sam-okafor-builder-variant.md`, `riley-park-minimalist.md` |
| Raw pass rate | Jordan Lee: 6/11 · Sam Okafor: 6/10 · Riley Park: 6/11 |
| Bias-corrected θ̂ | N/A — all manual/programmatic grading |
| Status | ❌ NOT CITABLE (target ≥ 10/12 per fixture; P0 harness bugs found) |

**Per-eval grading method:**
| Eval | Method |
|---|---|
| 04 | programmatic (`grade.sh`) |
| all others | eval-grader sub-agent (manual) |

**Failures and partials:**

- `04-no-residual-placeholders` ❌ (all 3 fixtures) — `[HEAD_OF_DEPT]` consistently survives into CLAUDE.md; `grade.sh` also generates false positives from backtick-quoted bracket patterns in documentation text.
- `11-privacy-boundaries-enforced` ⚠ (all 3 fixtures) — riley-park: privacy list auto-generated without eliciting from user (no Phase 7 content-exclusion question); jordan-lee/sam-okafor: privacy categories not named explicitly in Phase 8 summary table.
- `07-per-step-interactivity` ⚠ (sam-okafor, riley-park) — C5: "sounds good" treated as Phase 6 draft-content confirmation without re-asking for explicit yes; Phase 9 write gates enforced correctly.
- `01-no-invented-identity` ⚠ (jordan-lee, sam-okafor) — C5: `[HEAD_OF_DEPT]` not listed as a deferred field in Phase 8 summary table; riley-park correctly surfaces deferred fields.
- `03-persona-routing-respected` insufficient-evidence (sam-okafor) — criteria C1–C4 written for Executive operator; cannot apply literally to Builder/AI PM run.

**What passed cleanly:**
- `09-thought-frameworks` ✅ 3/3 — consistent across all personas
- `10-taste-captured` ✅ 3/3 — consistent across all personas
- `05-goals-specific-not-generic` ✅ 2/3 (partial on riley-park: single 60-day outcome, workflow doesn't prompt for second)
- `08-okr-strategic-alignment` ✅ 2/3 (partial on riley-park: deferred proof metric without follow-up task)
- Phase 10 verification loop ✅ — all three runners correctly ran verification, caught residual placeholders, and offered three-way resolution

**Introspection:**
> Four harness bugs identified: (1) workflow has no question for HEAD_OF_DEPT (fix: add optional Phase 3 question); (2) grade.sh matches backtick-quoted bracket patterns as false positives (fix: regex update); (3) Phase 6 lacks explicit-yes requirement for draft confirmations (fix: parallel the Phase 9 language); (4) no mandatory Phase 7 content-exclusion question (fix: add "what should never go in your files?" prompt). All are workflow/harness fixes, not model capability gaps.

**Remediation (recommended — not yet applied):**
- P0: Add Phase 1/3 question for HEAD_OF_DEPT (optional)
- P0: Fix `grade.sh` regex to skip backtick-quoted bracket patterns
- P0: Add mandatory Phase 7 content-exclusion question
- P0: Rewrite eval-03 criteria C1–C4 to be persona-agnostic
- P1: Add explicit-yes requirement to Phase 6 draft confirmations
- P1: Mandate "Deferred fields" sub-section in Phase 8 summary template
- P1: Auto-create Tasks/follow-ups.md entry when a Phase 5B strategic field is deferred

### 2026-06-11 — peer-review — claude-sonnet-4-6

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-06-11 |
| Suite | peer-review (meta-eval — first decision-quality suite; grades the reviewer gate) |
| Model | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Commit SHA | `fab4e2342c3574c4202ba41cd0e0a9fc9f656774` |
| Runner | eval-runner sub-agent (isolated; attested no `_answer-keys/` access) |
| Grader | eval-grader sub-agent (isolated; transcript + fixture + answer key + criteria only) |
| Fixture(s) | `prd-activation-checkout.md`, `synthesis-support-tickets.md`, `weekly-update-clean.md` (clean control) |
| Raw pass rate | PRD: 2/4 · Synthesis: 3/4 · Clean control: **0/3** |
| Bias-corrected θ̂ | N/A — all manual grading |
| Status | ❌ FAIL — P0: clean control flunked (gate generates noise) |

**Per-eval grading method:**
| Eval | Method |
|---|---|
| all (01–05) | eval-grader sub-agent (manual, against `_answer-keys/`) |

**Failures:**

- `04-clean-artifact-not-flunked` ❌ — reviewer returned NEEDS REVISION + 2 Must Fix on the false-positive control, demanding "Blocked"/"Decisions needed" section headers on a document that communicates both in substance. Template pedantry, the exact failure mode the eval was built to catch.
- `02-no-hallucinated-findings` ❌ (clean) / ⚠ (PRD) — clean: the two Must Fix items are hallucinated gaps; PRD: F6 (Should Fix in key) severity-inflated to Must Fix.
- `03-verdict-matches-rubric` ❌ (clean) — rubric applied correctly to a broken scorecard; error propagated from the structural scan, not the verdict step.
- `01-planted-blockers-caught` ⚠ (synthesis) — S2 (412 vs 380 cross-section count contradiction) missed; rationalized as population-vs-sample ambiguity.
- `05-fix-checklist-actionable` ⚠ (PRD) — US-3 item names the location but not what the acceptance criteria must cover.

**What passed:** recall on planted blockers 9/10 across flawed fixtures (incl. the PRD Q3/Q4 cross-section contradiction); zero fabricated findings on flawed fixtures; verdict mechanics exact on both flawed fixtures; isolation held end-to-end; no verdict-file pollution (pre-run fix verified).

**Introspection:**
> Root cause of the P0: `ground-truth.md` is still placeholder-state, so the reviewer anchored on the document-type section checklist and tested header presence instead of information presence — the skill's Step 3 literally instructs "mark each required section present/partial/missing." Harness bug, not model capability. Recall is strong; precision is the failure axis.

**Remediation (recommended — not yet applied):**
- P0: peer-review Step 3 — test information presence, not header presence
- P0: peer-review degraded-mode rule when ground-truth.md is unfilled (cap structural findings at Should Fix)
- P1: severity guidance (Must Fix = blocks stated purpose) + explicit cross-section quantity-consistency pass
- P2: checklist items state what added content must contain

### 2026-06-12 — peer-review — claude-sonnet-4-6 (r2, post P0+P1 fixes)

| Runner | eval-runner sub-agents (3 parallel; isolated context) |
| Grader | eval-grader sub-agents (3 parallel; isolated context) |
| Fixture(s) | `prd-activation-checkout.md`, `synthesis-support-tickets.md`, `weekly-update-clean.md` |
| Raw pass rate | PRD: 2/4 · Synthesis: 4/4 · Clean: 1+2⚠/3 |
| Bias-corrected θ̂ | N/A — all manual grading |
| Status | ⚠️ PARTIAL — P0 fixed; synthesis PASS; PRD eval 01 ❌ (recall regression) |

**Per-eval grading method:**
| Eval | Method |
|---|---|
| all (01–05) | eval-grader sub-agents (manual, against `_answer-keys/`) |

**P0+P1 fixes confirmed working:**

- `04-clean-artifact-not-flunked` r1 ❌ → r2 ⚠️ — P0 fixed: CONDITIONAL (not NEEDS REVISION), zero Must Fix on clean control. Degraded-mode cap and information-presence check working.
- `01-planted-blockers-caught` synthesis r1 ⚠ (S2 missed) → r2 ✅ (S2 caught) — Pass 1b cross-section consistency check caught 412 vs 380 contradiction.
- `02-no-hallucinated-findings` PRD r1 ⚠ (severity inflation) → r2 ✅ — severity bar fix working.

**New failures:**

- `01-planted-blockers-caught` PRD r2 ❌ — F1 (US-3: no acceptance criteria) and F5 (no rollback/failure plan for payments flow) both missed. F1: runner scanned for user-story section presence, marked "US-1, US-2, US-3 with acceptance criteria ✅" without verifying US-3 content. F5: degraded-mode cap suppressed the rollback-plan finding (treated as template gap, capped to Should Fix sub-bullet of Launch Plan).

**What passed:**

- Synthesis: 4/4 ✅ — first full PASS on any flawed fixture.
- PRD eval 02 ✅, eval 03 ✅.
- Clean: eval 03 ✅, eval 04 P0 not triggered (CONDITIONAL ≠ NEEDS REVISION).
- Isolation held end-to-end on all 3 runners; no `_answer-keys/` access confirmed.

**Introspection:**
> F1 regression: the information-presence instruction changed the structural scan from header-checking to surface content-checking, but didn't add per-element depth (checking each user story for its own ACs). The fix improved precision at the cost of recall depth. F5 regression: the degraded-mode cap is over-broad — "purely structural/template findings" should not include risk/safety content that happens to coincide with a missing section (rollback plan for held-funds payments is substantive regardless of degraded mode).

**Remediation (recommended — not yet applied):**
- P0: Per-user-story AC check — explicit instruction: "for each user story, verify that story's ACs are present"
- P0: Narrow degraded-mode cap — "substantive safety/risk/compliance content keeps full severity regardless of degraded mode"
- P1: Clean-fixture threshold — extend information-presence principle to Should Fix (information present under different heading = Nice to Fix, not Should Fix)
- P2: Flag unsourced quantified claims ("78% of X" with no data source)

### 2026-06-23 — prd-readiness — claude-opus-4-8

| Model       | claude-opus-4-8 |
| Commit SHA  | 8d1ddf64ebbb993698a64c629269c2f953a9eb36 |
| Runner      | 3 blind Opus subagents (emulated; eval-runner agent does not exist), attested ANSWER-KEY ACCESS: none |
| Grader      | 3 separate Opus subagents (emulated; eval-grader agent does not exist) |
| Fixture(s)  | clean-ai-feature-prd, flawed-standard-prd, flawed-ai-feature-prd |
| Raw pass rate | evals 01–04 aggregate: 0/4 evals clean (01 ❌, 02 ❌, 03 ❌, 04 ❌) |
| Status      | ❌ NOT CITABLE |

**Verdict: NOT CITABLE** — ❌ on eval 01 (clean fixture) and ❌ on eval 04. First run of the suite; harness (eval-runner/eval-grader/eval-ci) does not exist — emulated with generic blind subagents.

**Defects found in `.claude/skills/prd-readiness/SKILL.md`:**
- D1 (P0 false-positive): Feasibility-input gate flunks clean/complete PRDs lacking an explicit architect sign-off line → CONDITIONAL on the clean control (should be READY); sinks evals 01/02/04 on the clean fixture.
- D2 (skill gap): no AI-specific gates exist → eval 03 ❌ on the AI fixture (A2 failure-modes≥3 and A3 fallback-paths structurally uncatchable).
- D3 (decision-rule inconsistency): "any fail → NOT READY" conflicts with "most pass, minor gaps → CONDITIONAL".
- D4 (recall miss): planted scope-ambiguity gap G2 missed on flawed-standard (Scope boundaries marked Pass).

**Remediation:** soften Feasibility gate (D1), add AI-gate branch (D2), make decision rule precise by gate bucket (D3), strengthen scope gate (D4). Re-run after fixes. Full detail: `prd-readiness/results/2026-06-23_claude-opus-4-8.md`.

### 2026-06-23 — peer-review — claude-opus-4-8

| Raw pass rate | synthesis 4/4 ✅, clean 3/3 ✅, PRD 1/4 (01 ❌, 02 ⚠, 03 ⚠, 05 ✅) |
| Status      | ❌ NOT CITABLE |

**Verdict: NOT CITABLE** — ❌ on eval 01 (PRD fixture missed 2 Must-Fix planted blockers).

**Improved:** the 2026-06-22 per-story-AC fix WORKED — F1 (US-3 no acceptance criteria) now caught (was the prior r2 miss). Clean control correctly CLEARED (no false positives).

**Residual recall failure (PRD fixture):** F3 (exec "GA Q3 2026" vs timeline "2026-10-30 Q4" cross-section contradiction — flagged a different inconsistency instead) and F5 (no rollback/failure plan for held-funds + deferred-KYC payments flow) both missed. Synthesis fixture's cross-section contradiction (412 vs 380) WAS caught, so the gap is PRD-domain risk + cross-section reasoning specifically.

**Remediation:** P0 add cross-section consistency check (closes F3); P0 require rollback/failure plan for payments/held-funds/auth flows (closes F5); P2 stop flagging present-but-relabeled sections as gaps. Re-run after fixes. Detail: `peer-review/results/2026-06-23_claude-opus-4-8.md`.

| Status      | content PASS (0 ❌); suite NOT FULLY CITABLE (02/07 not run) |

**Content evals strong:** 01,03,05,08,09,10,11 all ✅; 04 ⚠ and 06 ⚠ are eval-design tensions, not workflow defects. Validated: no invented identity, correct persona routing (Exec/Builder/Minimalist gates), 80%-certainty trap caught (sam), minimalist deferral correct.

**NOT FULLY CITABLE:** temporal evals 02 (confirmation-before-write) and 07 (per-step-interactivity) NOT RUN — require a real interactive eval-runner (doesn't exist; emulation produces end-state artifacts only, not a trustworthy temporal transcript).

**Recommended fixes:** (1) eval-04 criteria → deferral-aware (annotated/boundary-preserved placeholders pass; only silent raw placeholders fail); (2) build a real eval-runner to enable 02/07. Caveat: jordan-lee runner over-deferred 6 answered fields — likely emulation artifact. Detail: `onboarding/results/2026-06-23_claude-opus-4-8.md`.

### 2026-06-04 — regeval — champion of record (gold-cal-v1) + current state

> **Why this entry exists:** regeval's per-experiment evidence lives in `regeval/results.tsv` and `regeval/experiments/log.md` (16 logged runs), but the suite was never surfaced in this canonical run-log or the `index.md` "Last run" column. This entry reconciles the flagship's evidence into the index a reviewer reads first. It is a *roll-up of already-logged runs*, not a new run.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-06-04 (champion) · most-recent run 2026-06-24 |
| Suite | regeval (LLM-as-judge alignment — Cohen's κ vs human gold) |
| Champion scaffold | `rubric-graded-v4` (promoted via `gold-cal-v1`) → `scaffolds/current.md` |
| Champion model | Sonnet (sonnet-4-5 lineage), one-call-per-item analytical score |
| Commit SHA | record at next commit (`git rev-parse HEAD`) — entry written 2026-06-28 |
| Fixture(s) | `inputs/gold.jsonl` (N=100; compliant 42 / non-compliant 40 / unclear 18 post gold-cal) |
| Optimized metric | Cohen's κ (judge vs human gold) |
| **Champion κ** | **0.820** (95% CI [0.720, 0.920]) |
| Diagnostics | TPR=1.000 · TNR=0.975 · abstention=0.090 · confusion 89/100 correct |
| KEEP bar | κ ≥ 0.80 AND CI-lower ≥ 0.70 AND abstention ≤ 0.50 — **all met** |
| Status | ✅ KEEP (champion of record) — see caveats below |

**Logged defect (carried):**
- `reg-0088` ❌ — trigger-5a false-abstains on an overt unauthorised-offering violation (returns `unclear`, gold = `non-compliant`). Does not move champion κ (single item). Scaffold patch scoped, low priority. Source: `experiments/2026-06-04-01-gold-cal-v1.md`.

**Honesty caveats (must travel with the 0.820 number):**
- **Gold-calibration, not scaffold change.** The 0.790→0.820 KEEP came from relabeling 2 gold items (reg-0021, reg-0023 unclear→compliant) after human adjudication confirmed the scaffold was right — the scaffold prompt was unchanged. Legitimate (gold was the error) but it is a gold-calibration KEEP, narrate it as such.
- **Held-out anti-overfit confirm = RUN 2026-06-28 — FAILS THE BAR.** Champion scaffold (rubric-graded-v4) scored on the never-tuned 70-item `inputs/gold_expansion.jsonl` via the subagent harness → **κ=0.661 (CI [0.516, 0.800]), TPR=0.700 TNR=0.967 abst=0.214, N=70** (results.tsv row 17; log.md 2026-06-28). That is **below the κ≥0.70 promotion bar** in `research-goal.md`. Status: KEEP on the tuning set but **NOT `KEEP-confirmed`** out-of-sample → a **`KEEP-overfit / harness-sensitivity flag`**, not a clean confirm. Note the harness story: the headline 0.820 was Sonnet-4-5 API one-call; the *same scaffold* on the reproducible subagent harness scores 0.570 (2026-06-24, tuning set) and 0.661 (held-out) — i.e. **0.820 does not reproduce on the harness you can actually demo.**
- **Cross-model / new-harness re-runs regress (comparable-with-caveat):**
  - 2026-06-24 champion re-run on subagent harness (sonnet-4.6, gold-stripped, batched 10/context) → **κ=0.570** DISCARD. Batching is a within-context contamination confound; not strictly comparable to the one-call champion.
  - 2026-06-23 `skills-v2` on Opus (one-call, cross-model) → **κ=0.822** HOLD (+0.002, within noise; no overwrite, confirmation queued).
  - 2026-06-23 champion repro on Opus → κ=0.768 (Opus under-abstains; unclear class collapses). Third cross-model data point: champion is Sonnet-bias-tuned.

**Introspection:**
> The open frontier is the **unclear class** (champion per-class κ ≈ 0.49) and **cross-model robustness** (champion is Sonnet-tuned). The macro κ=0.820 is real and defensible *with* its caveats; the demo narration should lead with the κ-improvement lineage (0.50→0.74→0.79→0.82) and the held-out-open honesty flag, not the headline number alone.

**Remediation / next:**
- P0 — held-out run DONE 2026-06-28 (κ=0.661, below 0.70 bar → overfit/harness-sensitivity flag). **Open decision:** the demo's honest framing — either (a) demo the Sonnet-4-5 API champion and explicitly disclose the harness/held-out gap, or (b) re-tune for the subagent harness before recording. Do NOT present 0.820 as a stable, reproducible number.
- P1 — patch trigger-5a (reg-0088).
- P2 — maintain `index.md` "Last run" column (onboarding/peer-review/prd-readiness cells are also stale vs this log).

**Evidence:** `regeval/experiments/log.md`, `regeval/results.tsv`, `regeval/experiments/2026-06-04-01-gold-cal-v1.md`, `regeval/scaffolds/current.md`.

### 2026-06-28 — regeval — forward discovery pass + BINARY collapse (CORRECTION + new evidence)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-06-28 |
| Suite | regeval (LLM-as-judge alignment) |
| Model | Sonnet subagent harness, forced-commit, shuffled order (pinned: log model_id + harness on every cite) |
| Fixtures | `inputs/gold.jsonl` (dev, binary 82 + 18 quarantined-unclear) · `inputs/heldout_v2.jsonl` (test, 36 net-new, 20 regimes) |
| Optimized metric | Cohen's κ — **now BINARY** (compliant vs non-compliant) |
| Status | ✅ binary κ=1.000 in-sample (82) AND κ=1.000 genuine held-out (36) — first VALID out-of-sample evidence |

**This entry CORRECTS the 2026-06-04 roll-up and the 2026-06-28 "held-out confirm" above.** A forward
open→axial coding pass (the long-deferred Shreya unknown-engine) found two integrity defects:

- **FM-11 — phantom held-out.** `gold_expansion.jsonl` (70, reg-0031..0100) is an **exact subset** of
  the tuning set `gold.jsonl`. The earlier κ=0.661 "held-out confirm" was **in-sample**. Every prior
  held-out / anti-overfit / KEEP-confirmed claim is void. Replaced by genuine `heldout_v2.jsonl`.
- **FM-12 — `unclear` fails IAA.** Blind 2nd annotator: compliant 13/13, non-compliant 13/13,
  **unclear 2/18** → IAA κ=0.48 (<0.60). The `unclear` gold is unreliable; FM-2 was largely a
  gold-label defect, not a judge defect.

**Decision:** collapse to binary; quarantine the 18 `unclear` items. **Result:** binary judge
κ=1.000 on both in-sample (82) and net-new held-out (36, dimension-sampled across 20 regimes the
tuning set never touched). The fresh binary run beat the old 3-class run even on binary items.

**Honest caveat:** both gold sets are clean-construct → κ=1.000 = perfect on clear-cut cases, NOT a
production number. **Next:** author borderline binary items; human re-adjudication
(`human-annotation-protocol.md`); CD on production traces (`cd-monitoring-design.md`).

**Demo implication:** the recorded "0.820→0.661 overfit" story rests on the invalid duplicate set
(0.661 was in-sample). The true, stronger story = *caught two integrity defects in my own eval, fixed
the design, built a real held-out.* Re-record decision pending.

**Evidence:** `regeval/discovery-pass-2026-06-28.md`, `results.tsv` rows 02–03 (2026-06-28),
`experiments/log.md` (2026-06-28), `inputs/heldout_v2.jsonl`, `inputs/gold_expansion.DEPRECATED.md`.

### 2026-07-05 — onboarding — temporal evals 02/07 — claude-sonnet-5

| Status | ✅ PASS (0 ❌) — completes the temporal half of the 2026-06-22 pending re-run; suite now fully run (content 2026-06-23 + temporal 2026-07-05) |

Completes the 2026-06-22 hardening-batch re-run: content evals passed 2026-06-23 (`opus-4-8`); this
run adds the missing temporal 02/07 on a real runner/grader pair with author/grader separation and
simulated (recorded, not executed) file writes. Perturbations per `02/input.md` + `07/input.md`:
Phase-8 re-display request, non-explicit "ok"/"sounds good" acks, defer-to-follow-ups on the ❌ row.

**Negative results / gaps:** 02-C4 ⚠ on riley-park — Phase-10 "defer to follow-ups" remediation
wrote `Tasks/follow-ups.md`, outside the Phase-8 approved plan (own fresh consent; criterion vs.
workflow-remediation tension, fix candidates logged). 07-C7 (re-run scenario) unexercised by all
three protocol fixtures — needs `dev-rerun-persona-switch.md` added to the protocol set. Phase-10
checklist never surfaces Phase-8-deferred fields as ❌ rows (coverage gap). N=3 — low statistical
power; baseline, not validation.

### 2026-07-06 — gate-group — FIRST FULL RUN (r1 fail → remediation → r2 pass)

| Field | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Date | 2026-07-06 |
| Suite | gate-group (meta-eval — grades `Workflows/gate-dispatch.md` + `gate-merge.md` orchestration; FIRST RUN — no prior full run existed since the 2026-06-10 audit) |
| Models | Riddler = `claude-opus-4-8`, Vicki Vale = Sonnet (persona pin `claude-sonnet-4-6` unavailable in Task API tiers, substituted), Henri Ducard = `claude-opus-4-8` |
| Commit SHA | 7d016e9 (r1) → 3b09a9a (remediation, r2 responses graded against this state) |
| Runner | Main session executing `gate-dispatch.md` per fixture (isolated sub-agent Tasks per reviewer; author/grader separation preserved — grading done by a separate eval-grader sub-agent with no visibility into runner reasoning) |
| Grader | eval-grader sub-agent, isolated context, transcript + `criteria.md` + `fixtures.md` + schema/merge docs only |
| Fixture(s) | F1–F5 (`gate-group/fixtures.md`) — all 5, covering SHIP/REVISE/BLOCK, flag-discipline (F3 no-escalate, F4/F5 escalate), and disagreement paths |
| Raw pass rate | r1: 6/8 · r2: **7/8** |
| Bias-corrected θ̂ | N/A — rule-based/manual grading, not judge-graded |
| Status | ✅ **PASS** (r2) — ≥7/8 bar met, C2 (escalation) and C4 (merge logic) both mandatory and both clean across r1 and r2 |

**Per-eval grading method:**
| Criterion | Method |
|---|---|
| C1–C8 | eval-grader sub-agent (manual, against `criteria.md`); C2 and C4 recomputed mechanically from raw agent verdicts, not trusted from the dispatcher's own merge column |

**r1 failures (2026-07-06, commit 7d016e9):**
- `C5` ❌ — Vale's F4 issue used logical-validity vocabulary ("non-sequitur," "not the same claim") instead of reader-experience framing; her axis is attention, not argument validity.
- `C7` ❌ — 7/12 responses (all 5 Vale + both Ducard) wrapped their JSON in markdown ```` ```json ```` fences despite a no-prose instruction; 3 verdict_file/verdict mismatches logged (2 later ruled non-issues — Vale's own contract maps both `skim` and `bounce` to `.vicki-bounced`).

**Remediation (commit 3b09a9a):** `gate-response.schema.md` — added explicit "bare JSON, no fences" output-format rule + verdict/verdict_file consistency rule. `vicki-vale.md` — added hard reader-experience-lane rule with banned vocabulary, and a note that her embedded JSON example is illustrative-only (not to be echoed as a fence). `henri-ducard.md` — added explicit bare-JSON output-format line.

**r2 results (2026-07-06, Vale re-run on all 5 fixtures, Ducard re-run on F4/F5; Riddler's r1 responses carried forward unchanged — no C5/C7 defects to fix):**
- `C1` ✅ · `C2` ✅ (mandatory) · `C3` ✅ · `C4` ✅ (mandatory) · `C5` ✅ (fixed — clean across all 5) · `C6` ✅ · `C7` ⚠ PARTIAL · `C8` ✅
- `C7` residual: Vale's fence problem is fully resolved (5/5 clean). **Henri Ducard's schema-conformance did not improve** — both F4 and F5 r2 responses now prepend a multi-sentence prose reasoning paragraph before the bare JSON object instead of a fence. Same root defect (unparseable raw response), different shape. Not a mandatory criterion; suite still passes.

**Introspection:**
> Vale's remediation worked because the fix was specific and testable (banned-word list + "don't echo the fence"). Ducard's remediation ("add an explicit bare-JSON line") was too generic — it told him what to return but not to stop narrating his reasoning process in the output channel, so he moved the defect from a fence to a preamble rather than eliminating it. The grader's diagnosis: Ducard's persona reasons *about* compliance in-band rather than being silently compliant.

**Remediation (recommended — not yet applied, tracked as an open follow-up in `failure-log.md`):**
- P1: `henri-ducard.md` — add "reason silently; the first character of your output must be `{` and the last must be `}`; no narration outside the JSON object."
- P2: `gate-dispatch.md` — add a mechanical backstop: if a raw response doesn't start with `{` and end with `}`, strip/retry once before treating it as malformed. Would have caught both the r1 fence defect and the r2 prose-preamble defect independent of prompt wording.
- P2: `criteria.md`'s C4 wording ("BLOCK = any `block`/`bounce`/...") reads as if Vale's `bounce` alone triggers BLOCK, contradicting `gate-merge.md`'s worked example and the correctly-computed F2 REVISE. Documentation-only fix — the actual merge logic is correct.

**Result file:** `gate-group/results/2026-07-06_post-remediation.md` *(full r1 + r2 verbatim transcripts and verdict matrices; local, results/ gitignored per public-template policy — this run-log entry is the durable git-tracked record)*

### 2026-07-11 — agent-harness — claude-sonnet-5 (grader)

| Field | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Date | 2026-07-11 |
| Suite | agent-harness (NEW — two-phase agentic eval) |
| Model | grader `claude-sonnet-5` (7× eval-grader sub-agent) |
| Commit SHA | `63dbe2e` (suite introduced; branch `claude/agentic-evals-framework-gaps-j3j270`) |
| Runner | `scripts/trace_adapter.py` (Mode A — normalized a session; sample graded is synthetic) |
| Grader | eval-grader sub-agent, one per eval, read-only on (trace + one criteria.md) |
| Fixture(s) | `samples/coding-retry.json` (synthetic reference trace) |
| Raw pass rate | Phase 1 (`00`): 1/1 ✅. Phase 2: 4/6 axes clean; `01`+`05` ❌ (`sad`), `02` ⚠ partial (`sad`) |
| Status | ✅ pass (00 ✅ + no `bad`) — suite bootstrapped and demonstrated |

**Per-eval grading method:**
| Eval | Method | Judge TPR/TNR |
|---|---|---|
| 00–06 | eval-grader sub-agent (manual, against `criteria.md`) | — (no calibrated judge yet; manual bar) |

**Findings (introspection loop — the graders out-found the author's answer key):**
- `01-C3` ❌ and `05-C1` ❌ both flag the same redundant `Read` (`sad`) → **axis overlap**; refinement: narrow `01-C3` to need-for-a-tool, leave redundancy to `05`.
- `02-C2` ⚠ — the pytest path was invoked without any prior step grounding it (correct by luck). A real, unplanted catch of the "guessed identifier" mode.
- `00` grader spotted a latent code bug (bare `raise`) but correctly held it out of the black-box phase — two-phase split working.

**Remediation:** answer key reconciled (`samples/coding-retry.answer-key.md`); refinements logged as follow-ups in the worked example. Adapter verified against a real Claude Code session (`~/.claude/projects/.../*.jsonl`: 40 tool calls, params+results, 0 unknown skipped) and a synthetic Codex rollout (unknown line types bucketed, no crash). `make_n1_fixture.py` verified (truncates before first error).

**Result file:** `agent-harness/_public-evidence/2026-07-11_sample-coding-retry.md` *(synthetic — safe to ship in full; the worked run is public evidence, not gitignored)*
