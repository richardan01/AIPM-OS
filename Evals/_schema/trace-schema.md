# Normalized trace schema

The **contract** shared by every harness adapter (`scripts/trace_adapter.py`) and every
consumer (the `agent-harness` eval suite, `/error-analysis`, `make_n1_fixture.py`).

Why this exists: Shankar & Husain define a *trace* as the complete record of messages,
tool calls, and retrievals from first user query to final response. Each harness
(Claude Code, Codex, Cowork) persists that record in its own JSONL dialect. This schema
is the single normalized shape they are all mapped onto, so the eval layer never has to
know which harness produced a session.

## Format

One JSON object per file: `Evals/<suite>/_traces/files/<trace_id>.json`.

```jsonc
{
  "trace_id": "ah-0001",              // suite-prefixed, stable
  "source_harness": "claude-code",    // claude-code | codex | cowork
  "session_id": "7a2b29c9-…",         // harness-native session id
  "captured_from": "~/.claude/projects/…/<session>.jsonl",
  "adapter_version": "1",             // bump when mapping logic changes
  "goal": "…",                        // first user turn — the task under evaluation
  "turns": [                          // ordered, main-thread only (sidechains excluded)
    { "i": 0, "role": "user",      "text": "…", "ts": "2026-07-11T03:07:02.946Z" },
    { "i": 1, "role": "assistant", "text": "…", "ts": "…" }
  ],
  "tool_calls": [                     // ordered; each call matched to its result by id
    {
      "i": 0,
      "name": "Bash",
      "params": { "command": "…" },   // the tool input, verbatim
      "result": "…",                  // result content (stringified if structured)
      "ok": true,                     // false when the harness flagged is_error
      "ts": "…",
      "turn_index": 3                 // which assistant turn issued it
    }
  ],
  "retrievals": [                     // subset of tool_calls the adapter classes as retrieval
    { "tool_call_index": 0, "name": "Grep", "query": "…" }
  ],
  "final_output": "…",                // last assistant text block
  "metrics": {
    "turn_count": 12,
    "tool_call_count": 35,
    "tool_error_count": 1,
    "input_tokens": 1234,             // null if the harness does not record usage.
                                      // Claude Code: non-cached input only — cache
                                      // reads are excluded, so this understates
                                      // true context size on cached sessions.
    "output_tokens": 5678,
    "wall_seconds": 184.4             // last_ts − first_ts; null if timestamps absent
  },
  "skipped_lines": { "queue-operation": 8, "unknown": 0 }  // version-tolerance audit
}
```

## Field rules

- **`goal`** — the first `user` turn whose content is a plain string (not a tool_result).
  This is what Phase-1 (E2E task success) grades against.
- **`tool_calls[].ok`** — `true` unless the harness marked the result an error. Feeds the
  `error-recovery` axis (did the agent recover after an `ok:false`?).
- **`retrievals`** — a *heuristic* classification (Read/Grep/Glob/WebFetch/WebSearch and
  the codex equivalents). Present so RAG-style retrieval quality can be graded separately,
  per the FAQ's retrieval/generation split. Not authoritative.
- **`skipped_lines`** — every input line the adapter did not map is counted here by its
  raw type. A non-zero `unknown` bucket is the signal that the harness changed its format
  and the adapter needs updating (both formats are internal + version-unstable per their
  own docs). The adapter **never** aborts on an unknown line; it counts and continues.

## Non-goals

- This is not a lossless mirror of the source JSONL. Sidechains (sub-agent transcripts),
  hook metadata, and mode/queue bookkeeping are intentionally dropped — the eval layer
  grades the main agent's trajectory, not the harness's internal plumbing.
- No PII scrubbing happens here. Sanitization for the public evidence tier is a separate,
  explicit step (see `Evals/agent-harness/_public-evidence/README.md`).
