# The Glass-Box Eval Loop

**An agentic eval framework that grades the agent *and* audits the grader.**

Most eval systems are black boxes twice over: they judge an agent only by its final answer,
and they never check whether the judge itself is trustworthy. The Glass-Box Eval Loop makes
both transparent — it grades the agent's full **trajectory** (two-phase agentic evaluation)
and subjects its own quality gates to **planted-flaw meta-evals**, so the evaluators are held
to the same bar as the thing they evaluate.

It is a faithful implementation of Shankar & Husain's **Analyze → Measure → Improve**
lifecycle (*Evals for AI Engineers*, O'Reilly 2026; [evals FAQ](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals-faq/)),
**extended with a fourth concern — Audit the evaluators** — grounded in Shankar et al.,
[*Who Validates the Validators?*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12272) (UIST 2024).

AI Product Lab is the reference implementation: a PM operating system is the application
domain, but the loop applies to any agentic product — a chatbot, a coding harness, a
multi-step agent. The goal is not to make AI write more documents. It is to make
AI-assisted work **measurable, reviewable, and continuously improvable** — and to make the
measurement itself inspectable.

## 1. Problem

Most PMs use AI through one-off prompts. That helps with speed, but it does not create a reliable system:

- context is rediscovered every time
- outputs are hard to compare across runs
- review standards live in the user's head
- failures do not automatically become better test cases
- workflow quality is assumed instead of measured

PM work needs the same loop discipline as software and model work: clear context, repeatable execution, quality gates, evals, monitoring, and a feedback path from failure to improvement.

## 2. Framework

```text
Trigger
  -> Context
  -> Agent workflow
  -> Artifact
  -> Quality gate
  -> Offline eval
  -> Human review
  -> Online monitoring
  -> Improvement
```

Each step has a job:

| Step | Role in the loop |
|---|---|
| Trigger | A user command or workflow request starts a bounded PM task. |
| Context | Repo-native knowledge, project files, tasks, and goals provide durable state. |
| Agent workflow | A documented workflow or skill performs the work in a repeatable way. |
| Artifact | The output is a PRD, review, launch gate, synthesis, update, plan, or decision record. |
| Quality gate | A reviewer loop checks whether the artifact is ready for handoff. |
| Offline eval | Separate grader contexts test workflows and gates against fixtures and answer keys. |
| Human review | The PM makes the judgment call and approves, revises, or rejects the output. |
| Online monitoring | Real artifacts are sampled after the fact and graded for failure trends. |
| Improvement | Recurring failures become new fixtures, rubrics, workflow edits, or knowledge updates. |

### The three gulfs (why the loop is shaped this way)

Shankar & Husain frame LLM development as crossing **three gulfs**. The loop's steps map
directly onto them:

| Gulf | The problem | Where the loop addresses it |
|---|---|---|
| **Comprehension** | You don't actually know what your system does on real inputs. | Trace capture + error analysis (open/axial coding on real trajectories). |
| **Specification** | You can't turn intent into precise instructions the model follows. | Quality gates + the introspection loop — every failure asks "what in the prompt misled it?" |
| **Generalization** | The system works on your examples but not on the long tail. | Offline suites + online monitoring — new failures in real usage become new fixtures. |

The framework's own addition sits on top: **who audits the evaluators that police these
gulfs?** — answered by the planted-flaw meta-evals in §4.

## 3. Architecture

The lab is intentionally simple: Markdown files are the operating surface.

| Layer | Repo surface | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Knowledge layer | `CLAUDE.md`, `Knowledge/`, `Projects/`, `Tasks/`, `GOALS.md` | Durable context, source of truth, working state, preferences, decisions, and provenance. |
| Workflow layer | `Workflows/`, `Templates/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/` | Repeatable PM processes and task-specific agent instructions. |
| Eval and monitoring layer | `Evals/`, `Evals/monitoring/`, `Evals/severity-taxonomy.md`, `Evals/_ci-map.md`, `Evals/_pending-reruns.md` | Offline audit suites, planted-flaw meta-evals, severity rules, and freshness sentinels. |

This follows the same pattern as agentic research systems: the human edits the operating instructions and review standards; agents execute bounded work; the metric and review loop decide whether the run improved the system.

## 4. Loop Design

### Daily PM Loop

```text
/today -> focused work -> artifact drafting/review -> /eod -> task/context update
```

This loop keeps `Tasks/active.md`, goals, blockers, and current context fresh so later workflows start with better state.

### Quality Gate Loop

```text
artifact -> gate rubric -> bad/sad severity -> verdict -> revision checklist
```

Quality gates separate drafting from review. They look for PM handoff risks such as hallucinated findings, missing acceptance criteria, weak evidence, unresolved red risks, or research that is too thin for the decision. Public artifacts additionally pass the Riddler (adversarial) and Vale (user-voice) gates before shipping.

### Offline Eval Loop

```text
fixture -> runner context -> transcript/output -> separate grader context -> score -> run log
```

Offline evals preserve author/grader separation. The runner creates the artifact; a fresh grader context applies criteria and, where relevant, answer keys. Results are recorded in `Evals/run-log.md` and suite-specific result files.

### Planted-Flaw Meta-Eval Loop

```text
known flawed artifact + clean control -> gate under test -> grader -> pass/fail
```

The lab does not only evaluate PM artifacts. It evaluates the gates themselves. A reviewer gate must catch known blockers, avoid hallucinated findings, and avoid flunking clean work. This is the framework's answer to Shankar et al.'s *Who Validates the Validators?* — an LLM-assisted evaluator inherits the failure modes of the model it evaluates, so it must itself be validated against ground truth before it is trusted.

### Online Monitoring Loop

```text
trace collector -> sample -> grade -> log -> analyze -> escalate
```

Real outputs are sampled asynchronously, graded in fresh contexts, bucketed by severity, and turned into new fixtures or workflow changes when failure patterns repeat.

## 5. Metrics

The useful metrics are tied to artifact quality and decision readiness:

| Metric | What it measures |
|---|---|
| Artifact pass rate | Share of artifacts that clear the relevant quality gate. |
| Bad-rate | Share of sampled artifacts with one or more irrecoverable `bad` findings. |
| Sad-rate | Recoverable friction that lowers artifact quality but does not block handoff. |
| Human approval rate | Share of AI-assisted outputs accepted with light edits. |
| Gate false-positive rate | Clean artifacts incorrectly blocked by a gate. |
| Gate false-negative rate | Flawed artifacts incorrectly cleared by a gate. |
| Eval freshness | Whether mapped workflows/gates have been re-run after relevant changes. |
| Decision readiness | Whether the output supports a real PM decision, escalation, or handoff. |
| Time saved | Time removed from formatting, search, synthesis, and drafting without lowering quality. |

The core portfolio metric is not output volume. It is whether the lab lowers the `bad` rate while preserving useful PM throughput.

## 6. Example Use Cases

| Use case | Workflow/gate | Eval or monitoring path |
|---|---|---|
| **Evaluate an agent trajectory** (chatbot, coding harness, agent) | `scripts/trace_adapter.py` (attach to Claude Code / Codex) | `Evals/agent-harness/` — two-phase agentic eval |
| AI feature PRD review | `/prd-readiness`, `/peer-review` | `Evals/prd-readiness/`, `Evals/peer-review/` |
| Research synthesis | `Workflows/user-research-synthesis/`, `/research-sufficiency` | `Evals/research-synthesis/`, `Evals/research-sufficiency/` |
| Launch readiness | `/go-nogo`, `/launch-plan` | `Evals/go-nogo/` |
| Build or artifact review | `/build-review`, `/eval-review`, `/test-plan` | `Evals/build-review/` |
| LLM-as-judge reliability | `Evals/regeval/` (RegEval flagship) | `Evals/regeval/regeval-suite.md`, `Evals/run-log.md` |
| Onboarding a PM into the OS | `Workflows/interactive-onboarding.md` | `Evals/onboarding/` |
| Weekly operating review | `/weekly-update`, `Evals/monitoring/` | Sample real artifacts, grade asynchronously, and feed new failures back into fixtures. |

### How this differs from commercial eval tooling

Trajectory tracing is not the differentiator — **LangSmith and Braintrust already do it, and
better**, for engineers instrumenting their own stack. This framework bets on four things
those tools are not built to provide:

| | Commercial eval platforms | The Glass-Box Eval Loop |
|---|---|---|
| Primary form | A hosted dashboard + SDK | A method, expressed as files in a repo |
| Evaluator trust | You write the judge; trusting it is on you | Judges are calibrated (TPR/TNR ≥ 0.9) **and** gates are meta-eval'd against planted flaws |
| Getting traces in | Instrument your code with the SDK | Read the JSONL your harness already writes (`trace_adapter.py`) |
| Audience | ML/AI engineers | PMs evaluating an agentic product they don't own the code for |
| Where it runs | Their cloud | Local, Markdown-native, nothing sent anywhere |

Use LangSmith/Braintrust when you own the code and want production observability. Use this
when you want the *discipline* — and when the honest question is "can I even trust my
evaluator?"

## 7. Why This Matters

This repo is not just a personal productivity system. It is a lightweight example of loop engineering for PM work:

- context compounds instead of being rediscovered
- workflows are explicit enough to improve
- review standards are captured outside the author's head
- gates are tested against planted flaws and clean controls
- monitoring finds new failures in real usage
- failures become better fixtures, better workflows, or better knowledge

That is the shift from AI as a writing assistant to AI as a measurable PM execution system.

## 8. Portfolio Framing

Use this framing when presenting the repo:

```text
AI Product Lab is a proof-of-work eval system for AI-assisted product work: it turns recurring product work into reviewed agentic workflows and then measures whether they actually work.

It combines repo-native knowledge, structured workflows, quality gates, offline eval suites, planted-flaw meta-evals that grade the gates themselves, a reproducible LLM-as-judge harness (RegEval), online monitoring, and weekly feedback loops.

The goal is to make AI-assisted product work measurable, reviewable, and continuously improvable.
