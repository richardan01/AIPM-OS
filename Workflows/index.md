## Gate workflow anatomy

The gate pipeline for public artifacts:

```
Nightwing / Lucius Fox signals "ready to ship"
  → gate-dispatch spawns Task A (Riddler) + Task B (Vicki Vale) in parallel
  → if Riddler.block AND Riddler.depth_gap_flag → Task C (Henri Ducard) spawns
  → gate-merge combines verdicts → SHIP / REVISE / BLOCK
```
